                <p>University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is where I finished my undergraduate education, and where my passion for learning ignited. During my two years at UIC, I covered many interesting and informative topics including: fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, numerical & computational methods, engineering design, and higher-level mathematics. I wrapped up my time at UIC with a 1st prize award at the 2015 UIC Engineering Expo for my part on the design team of an endoluminal sewing machine.</p>

                <p>I entered College of Dupage (COD) after high school with no real direction. I questioned taking a semester off, but decided to take an introductory engineering course as a last ditch effort. The material sucked me in, and I remember the day I wanted to get into the sciences; The professor wrote a differential equation on the board and asked an upper classman a question about it. It was like black magic to me, and I wanted to know how it worked.</p>
